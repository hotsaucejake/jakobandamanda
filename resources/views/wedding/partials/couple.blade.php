                            <p>Shortly after we met, Jakob told me that his mission was to make me smile or laugh every single day. He is truly a man of his word, and I am so grateful to share my life with him. We are looking forward to celebrating with our dearest friends and family soon!  </p>

                            <p>I know what all of you are thinking, and you're right... I <em>don't</em> deserve Amanda.  I let her know that every day in both words and actions.  I remember the first day I saw her, there was a glow about her - it's probably because she was sitting in front of a window in the sunlight.  Nevertheless, she has never lost that glow and grows more beautiful by the day.  </p>
