                                <p>We first met on Jakob's first day at Corus360.  February 17 is the day after Amanda's birthday, and Jakob still likes to joke that he is her greatest gift.  Jakob remembers sitting directly across from her at lunch and how he couldn't keep his eyes off of her.  We soon began secretly conversing via email, texting, and instant messaging, eventually forming our own unique code-language that we're convinced nobody else will be able to decipher.</p>

                                <p>Amanda thought it would be a great idea to move back to Charlotte, North Carolina.  Jakob thought it would be an even better idea to chase her, driving up to Charlotte occasionally on weekends in order to take her on dates.  Our first date included bowling, disc golf, a local brewery, walks on nature trails, and a movie.  Jakob would plan elaborate dates from afar to show Amanda what she might be missing. The distance somehow brought us closer, and we soon realized that a few state lines weren't going to keep us apart.</p>

                                <p>On February 17, 2014, a new chapter in our life began when we met each other.  Over the course of four years, we've celebrated many new beginnings in our relationship.  We started out as coworkers who quickly became friends, and our friendship soon developed into a romance we had only ever read about in novels.  It's only fitting that Jakob surprised Amanda at the starting line of her race to ask her to be his wife.  February 17th will always be the day of beginnings for us! </p>
